red2gmx is a (somewhat hackish) little program that
reads a PDB which has been protonated/corrected with the Reduce program
(http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/reduce.php). It removes repeated 
atoms (keeping the one labeled "A", which should have the highest occupancy)
and outputs a serie of numbers that can be used by the Gromacs program
pdb2gmx in order to create a Gromacs topology that has the protonation states
assigned by Reduce for residues ASP, GLU, LYS, ARG and HIS. 
red2gmx will also output a PDB without the hydrogens, that can be
used as an input for pdb2gmx.

Use:

./red2gmx  1 1 file.pdb

The first two numbers correspond to the first two questions that pdb2gmx will ask:
The wanted forcefield and the water model. Please do a test run of pdb2gmx on your
system so you know what number corresponds to what model.

red2gmx will output several things, including a column of numbers. Copy that column
and paste it in a file which we will call "gmx_input.dat". Note that red2gmx has
produced a file called file_cleanNoH.pdb (where file is the name of your file).
Now call pdb2gmx in the following way:


gmx pdb2gmx  -his -asp -glu -lys -arg  -f file_cleanNoH.pdb -o file.gro < gmx_input.dat

After this, you should have a correct Gromacs topology that has protonation states
that match those determined we Reduce. You can check that comparing the resulting structure
with the red2gmx output, which also shows in human-readable form the state of each 
residue.

red2gmx uses the goChem library (github.com/rmera/gochem), and the devel branch of
goChem is currently needed to build red2gmx. If you use it, please cite goChem,
as well as Reduce.
